# blockring
blockring is a building block for sharding, replicating and storing data.  It has a peer-to-peer master-less design, which is highly-available and scalable with no single point of failure.

## Data Categories
There are 2 main data categories.  This determines how data is written to the ring.

- Immutable
- Mutable

### Immutable

### Mutable

### Roadmap

- [ ] Node failure
- [ ] Node leave
- [ ] Replication
- [ ] Compaction
- [ ] Mutable data
    - [ ] Log
    - [ ] Consensus
- [ ] Optimizations
